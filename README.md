# Existence
A Roblox Death Sound Changer!

### How does it work?
Existence modifies your Roblox file "ouch.ogg" by replacing it with our death sounds!

### What death sound does it support?
Currently, Existence only supports the "oof" and "yippee" death sounds. Hopefully, in the future, there will be more death sounds!

### Is this bannable?
No, Existence only changes your death sound, it doesn't modify the game client itself, so there would be no point for this to be bannable.

### Is it safe?
Yes, Existence is open-source, meaning that everything is public. If you still do not trust it, feel free to use a virtual machine or VirusTotal to scan the file!

### Will it cause any issue at my device?
No, as long as you don't modify the Existence, you should be fine.

### Does it take up a lot of my space in my device?
No, Existence only modifies your Roblox file "ouch.ogg", and it's a .cmd format program. Even if you're using our .exe format program, it wouldn't take up a lot of space on your device.

### Cool! Where can I download it?
You may use the source code or you could download our .exe program, but it is recommended to use .exe, because you will received a Roblox death sound changer with girl pfp icon!
(If you don't trust the .exe, it's fine)
